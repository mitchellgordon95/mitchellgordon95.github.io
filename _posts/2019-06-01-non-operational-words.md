title: "Non-Operational Words"
---

I've talked previously about [being a hardcore empiricist](). I realized recently this makes
me difficult to have a normal conversation with. My friend Raied put it best:

> Mitchell, why don't you ever answer my questions directly?  
> Instead, you ask me something like, "what do you mean by 'mean'?"  
> It's very frustrating.

Apparently I don't do well with ambiguity. More specifically, I have a pet peeve
regarding **non-operational words**. A non-operational word
is simply a word that doesn't have an operational definition. [From
wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operationalization):

> Operationalization is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon
> that is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred by other
> phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a fuzzy concept so as to make it
> clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by empirical
> observation.

I like calling things "non-operational" because it has a dual meaning. One is
above. The other means the word just "doesn't work" for me. It's
non-functional. To relate to the previous discussion, non-operational words are
"purely abstract" and live in the abstract plane. I don't know how to
instantiate them in the real world.

Some people might call me pedantic. That might be true, depending on their
definition of pedantic. But I claim that operationalizing isn't just about
science and engineering. It's about getting on the same page with whoever you're
talking to. It's about diving deeper into their mind to figure out what they
*really* mean when they say they "want the world to be a better place."

If you don't operationalize effectively, you're bound to have some
miscommunications along the way. Below are a few examples.

## Name That Color

Two of my lab mates (I'll call them Doug and Evan) had a disagreement about the
color of Evan's glasses. Everyone agreed that Evan's glasses frames looked
BLACK.

But then Doug made an observation: if you held the frame up to the light, you
could see the material was actually a deep, translucent red. And so Doug claimed
the glasses were RED. Evan countered that it was a special case, and since they
looked BLACK most of the time, the glasses were BLACK. Doug said the material
was actually RED, so the glasses should be called RED regardless of how it
appeared most of the time. And thus they were gridlocked.

Meanwhile, I'm in the back just begging for this stuff to be operationalized.
Let's start with grade-school physics, to get on the same page.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Objects appear to have color because they only reflect certain wavelengths of
light. White objects reflect most wavelengths, red[^1] objects reflect red light
and absorb the rest, black objects absorb all the light. Interestingly, if you
only have red lights in a room, everything looks either red or black, because
there's no other wavelengths to reflect.

So we might operationalize the definition of color as "the wavelength of light
that bounces off or through the object and hits your retina when in the presence
of white light." That's not bad, and it lets everyone be right. Depending on the
experimental set-up, an object might be BLACK or RED at different times. It also
makes clear the dependence of color on light available in the room and the
position of the observer with respect to the object.

But why did Doug see RED? Some objects, while they don't reflect light, allow
certain wavelengths to pass *through* them. This has to do with the [scattering
effect](https://omlc.org/classroom/scat_demo/) of some translucent objects, and
it's why the [sky is blue](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/).

</div>


Of course, I explained that what Doug wanted to say might be more
commonly understood as the refractive index of the material or something like
that. But nope, Doug wouldn't budge. The glasses were RED, that was that. Well,
at least I tried.

## Creative Sauce

Another day, my friend Ned told me he'd like to create a world in which "people
express their maximum creativity." Me being me, I asked him, "what do you mean
by creativity?" His first definition wasn't very satisfying:

> People have some kind of "creative sauce" in their brains. I don't know if it
> really exists, but you can tell when it comes out.

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

I countered with an operational (if not very efficient) definition: I'd keep him
with me wheverever I went. When I saw something I thought might be creative, I'd
point to it, and he'd tell me whether or not it was actually creative. This is
highly reproducible for me; there's little ambiguity about what is and isn't
creative. It also makes it clear that the definition of creative is highly
subjective.[^2] He didn't really want to walk around with me, so he tried again:

> A person is being creative when they observe something in the world and react to it.

I asked him if walking down the street was creative. After all, I'm observing
the street and reacting to it. Obviously that's not quite right, so he tried a third time:

> Creativity is maximized when there's high variance among the thoughts and
> actions of people in the world.

I finally got to the bottom of it. In his mind, the worst case scenario was
something like 1984, where no one thinks independently and just accepts what the
AI overlords tell them to think.

Now you might not think that matters much. But this all came up in the context
of him deciding what job offer to accept and what he was going to do with his
life. And if "maximizing creativity" is your life's goal, you better know what
it means. This brings me to...

## Objections to Operationalizing

> You don't have to operationalize to come to a consensus. 

Sure, sometimes. Spoon, chair, eat, person. People will understand what these
things mean without defining them in terms of basic senses or empirical
observations. The point of talking is to communicate information. If you
reasonably believe that the person has a similar world view to you, and you can
get away with just a few words, then by all means do so. Then you can both have
a unified view of the world and how you're going to build things moving forward.

But I'd argue misunderstandings are probably more common than people think.
Consider "person." I said you didn't need to operationalize, but is a fetus a
person? If so, then getting an abortion is murder and illegal. If it's not,
then abortion is a woman's right to take control of her own body. What about robot
people, a la [Westworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuS5huqOND4)? If a
robot is indistinguishable from a normal person, do they still deserve human
rights? Could you make them slaves?

</div>

See, in order for the law to be effective, we need operational definitions of
words. We need everyone to be on the same page, so we know what's Gucci and
what's not. The abortion issue is centered around this: trying to operationalize
when a fetus becomes a human. I'm not saying operationalizing will fix this
problem; indeed it is the problem. But you can see how it's necessary to gain
concensus about what ought to be done.

> I don't know enough about X to operationalize my words.

Great! Say that. We can look it up together. Or better yet, we can run some
experiments and write a paper. If you really can't operationalize something,
it's probably not productive to keep discussing it until we have more
information.

> Operationalization is impossible for some words.

Like I explained in [my previous blog post](), allowing things to live in the
"abstract plane" is really just an un-scientific way of thinking and leads to
these kinds of disagreements. You can't apply reason to abstract things, because
they exist outside of our single, unified model of the physical world. 

And besides, because you are a human, you think in terms of sight, smell, taste,
feel etc. Eventually everything can be reduced to some combinations of these
feelings. Example: imagine a "kind" person. You now probably have some image in
your head. Try to sharpen it. Are they smiling? What's their body language like?
What action are they in the middle of doing? How do they react to bullying? Etc.
Operationalizing "kind" would be hard, but not impossible. These kinds of
questions get you to the heart of what you actually mean when you say things
(and may make you realize you didn't mean what you said). This striving to
define things in terms of empirical observations is a cornerstone of science.

</div>


In fact, non-operational words might also just be called "pre-scientific" words.
Like Geoff Hinton mentioned in his [Wired
interview](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-pioneer-explains-evolution-neural-networks/):

> So 100 years ago, if you asked people what life is, they would have said,
> “Well, living things have vital force, and when they die, the vital force goes
> away. And that's the difference between being alive and being dead, whether
> you’ve got vital force or not.” And now we don't have vital force, we just
> think it's a prescientific concept. And once you understand some biochemistry
> and molecular biology, you don't need vital force anymore, you understand how
> it actually works.

I think that as we understand intelligence and neuroscience more, many words
like "creativity" or "consciousness" will be recognized as prescientific terms
just like "vital force" was. In general, the more science we do, the better we
get at operationalizing things.

## Abstractness

You might have some intuition about how hard it is to operationalize a word. You
might say that a word is more "abstract" or "concrete" without being able to
quite put your finger on what that means.

One of [my favorite papers](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1199) from last
year operationalizes this idea of abstractness, provided you have a specific
machine learning dataset with both pictures and words. In these datasets, each
picture is tagged with some words (like on
[Flickr](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset)).

<div style="text-align: center">
<img  widht="200px" height="200px" src="{{'/assets/concreteness_dog.png' | absolute_url }}">
<h6>Source - <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1199">Quantifying the visual concreteness of words and topics
in multimodal datasets</a></h6>
</div>

They define "abstractness" by how tightly images that your word describes are
clustered in feature space. That's kind of a heavy definition, so maybe think of
it this way: all pictures tagged with "dog" have a dog in them somewhere. Those
pictures are thus similar and clustered in feature space. "Dog" is concrete.
However, "beautiful" is tagged on a bunch of pictures with extremely high
variance. If one picture is tagged as "beautiful," it's not clear that it's
nearest neighbors will be tagged "beautiful" (not all pictures of the ocean are
pretty). And therefore "beautiful" is abstract.

So even things that seem really hard to wrap your head around can be
operationalized. Now, this might not be the best way to do it... but we can
always certainly go back and revise our definition. At least we're on the same
page and can work towards that better definition. Actually, I really like this
definition because it makes it clear that "abstractness" depends on the way in
which you ground your concepts in physical senses (like sight). It's dataset dependent.

## Conclusion

So please, do me a favor: think deeply. Operationalize when you can. It'll make
your conversations more meaningful and help you avoid miscommunication. It's one
step closer to everyone getting on the same page.

[^1]: Defining which wavelengths are red isn't quite so cut-and-dry. Depending
    [on your language](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/31/7937.full.pdf)
    and whether you're color blind, we might have a hard time agreeing on what
    to call red. But at the very least we can use a machine to measure the
    wavelengths of the light coming off the object.
    
[^2]: If we wanted to make it less subjective, we might imagine (theoretically)
    showing that potentially creative thing to everyone who spoke English and
    asking them to vote on whether or not it was creative. If more than half say
    yes, we could call it creative. If we actually ran this experiment, we might
    see some interesting results: maybe people tend to call things creative that
    are simply surprising? Then we could come up with a quantitative measure of
    surprising based on what usually appears on public television, social media,
    etc. Then we could short-cut the vote and make a prediction. Now that's
    science.
