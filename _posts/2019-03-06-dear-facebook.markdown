Dear Facebook,

If you want to facilitate meaningful social interactions, get rid of the feed, and maybe even the wall. Keep events, keep market, and keep messenger. Everything else is great.

Yes, it's easy to get users to post on their wall. But no, unfortunately, sharing photos of your last Japan trip with anyone who will look at them isn't a meaningful interaction, it's *narcissism*. Clicking "like" on a photo of a cute dog isn't a meaningful interaction, it's a [*little bump of cocaine*](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/). If you want users to have "meaningful" interactions, make them actually talk to each other. If they want to share something, make them choose exactly who to share it with. That makes that person or group *special*, and when they respond, you feel like you've shared a special, private moment together. This is how you build friendships (or [rapport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapport), if you're a manipulative salesman). 

Furthermore, it raises the bar for responses and frees the responder to say what they really think. When someone sends something *to you*, you're obligated to put in a little more effort than just clicking like (unless you're intentionally trying to blow them off). And if it's just the two of you, you're free to say what you actually think about the Obama administration, instead of what you'd say if, you know, your grandma and the rest of your friends might see it. Your relationships will [likely flourish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk) (I know mine did).

So do us all a favor; get rid of the feed. Or at least get rid of the *inifinitely-scrolling* feed. I mean, come on guys, you know what your doing. Stop grabbing everyone by the balls with your dopamine attention machine and actually do what your mission statement says. Yes, I know the company runs on ad revenue. Maybe it's time to change that? Given all the [bad press](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions) lately, I'm sure everyone would understand if you introduced an "ads-free, tracking-free, paid version," which just happened to include a "digital wellness" feature, that just turns off all your [growth hacks](https://hackernoon.com/anti-growth-hacking-f2ffb2810203) (yes, even the "red jewel").

If you don't, [someone else will](https://joinmastodon.org/).

Yours,

Mitchell
