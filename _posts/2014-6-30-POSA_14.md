The summer of my freshman year, I interned at Vanderbilt's Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS). I worked with Dr. Doug Schmidt and Dr. Jules White, helping them teach courses on Coursera.org relating to Android development. Dr. Schmidt's course dealt with pattern oriented software architecture for concurrency in Android systems, and Dr. White's course dealt with mobile-cloud development and the networking and back-end technologies involved. I went on to TA Dr. Schmidt's course at Vanderbilt called Operating Systems II, which dealt with many of the same topics.
