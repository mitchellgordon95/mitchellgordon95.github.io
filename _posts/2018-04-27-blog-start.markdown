I've wanted to start a blog for a while.

Why now? Well, a friend of mine started a blog [about her dog](https://medicineandmuses.blogspot.com/) and, despite her lack of technical skills, it looks nice with pictures and stuff. This has ignited what little competitive spirit I still have, leading to the bare-bones construction you currently behold. The content of her site has also encouraged me to write about my thoughts and life; not all blog posts must be ground-breaking insights. 

I've also become fascinated with RSS. I'd love to see people share updates about their lives through personal sites on the open web rather than social media platforms like Facebook, where news and content become twisted within the grips of ranking algorithms. I see RSS as a simple and beautiful alternative that helps you keep up with what's going on.

And so, after an hour and a half of scrapping my old (poorly designed) website and getting Jekyll set up again, I have a place to document my humble pursuit of knowledge, happiness, the meaning of life, etc.
