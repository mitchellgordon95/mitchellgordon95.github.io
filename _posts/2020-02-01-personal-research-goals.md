I'm grateful for John Schulman's [Opinionated Guide to ML
Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html), if only
for articulating the difference between idea-driven and goal-driven research.
This is something that took me the first year and a half of my Ph.D. to figure
out, and I'm still trying to pin down my own "research taste" and
long-term goals.

I've decided to post a few of my goals here, forcing myself to organize and critique
my thoughts while simultaneously putting myself on the public record (which will be
fun to look back at in a few years). They're vaguely ordered by the likeliness that I'll
spend time on them.

1. Develop more compression methods with provable [approximation guarantees](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gmHaEKwB).

2. Make [AI Dungeon 2](https://aidungeon.io/) more semantically coherent and game-like.

3. Achieve BERT-level performance from scratch for less than $100 of compute. (Currently $7,000).
- Using better [over-parameterization bounds, optimization methods,](http://mitchgordon.me/machine/learning/2020/01/13/do-we-really-need-model-compression.html) and [architectures](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkgNKkHtvB)  
<br>

4. Align the compression community on comparable metrics.

5. Solve MNIST with a quantum computer simulator 
- More of a personal goal than a [research milestone](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/12/exploring-quantum-neural-networks.html).  
<br>

6. Improve machine translation in low-resource domains.
- Why does domain adaptation help?
- What is a principled way of doing domain adaptation?
- How is this related to fine-tuning pre-trained models?  
<br>

7. Bring theory back to DL (not my field)
- [Generalization bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02178) these days exploit the fact that effective model complexity is usually less than possible.
- Might a complete understanding of compression methods lead to better [generalization bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05296)?

Writing this list revealed how very few real or novel problems I am aware of.
Most problems I know about (especially #6 and #7) come from reading the
literature. They're idea-driven rather than goal-driven research, almost by
definition. I'm excited to get back out into the [real
world](https://www.asapp.com/) this summer and get some exposure to more novel
problems.
