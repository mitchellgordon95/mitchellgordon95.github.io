A Gamemaster runs a gambling ring in which gamblers bet on a coin flip.

He is required, by law, to test his coin to ensure fairness. So he flips the coin a million times, recording 500,000 each heads and tails. He concludes that the coin is not unreasonably biased.

Unbeknownst to him, his coin had been switched for one made of iron. The time comes for betting, and a Cheater palces a large magnet under the table, causing the coin to land on heads every time.

The other players become reasonably upset, and after the 50th head in a row, they mob the Gamemaster, string him up, and stone him to death.
