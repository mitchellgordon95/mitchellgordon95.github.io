The student saw a monk sitting in the courtyard. He did not move.

For forty nights and days, the student returned to the courtyard to watch the monk, who still did not move.

On the fortieth day, the monk died and still did not move.

The student asked the master, "why has he done this?"

"To demonstrate his free will," the master replied.

"Why?"

"Someone told him he did not have any," the master replied.

"Were they right?"

"It does not matter. He is dead now."
