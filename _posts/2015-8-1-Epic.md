In the Summer of 2015, I interned as a software developer with Epic, helping them create innovative and easy to use health care software for hospitals around the globe. My project dealt with adding experimental functionality to Epic's Hyperspace and Monitor applications, which was inspired by the way nurses used whiteboards in inpatient care.
