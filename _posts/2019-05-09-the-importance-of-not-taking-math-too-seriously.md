title:  "The Importance of Not Taking Math Too Seriously"

I used to take math really seriously. As a student, I worried about getting the
"right" answer or figuring out the "right" way to think about things. While
there's nothing wrong with trying to be correct, these feelings really impeded
my ability to do good math. Anxiety makes it hard to learn new things or see
things from a different perspective, which is exactly what you need to do
good math. Instead, I started seeing math as a *creative* endeavor, and I figured
out that I do my best work when I'm having fun.

I used to see the same thing happen when I tried to write songs or essays. If you
try to write the perfect song on your first try, you'll never be able to write a
single word. You'll freeze up.

In writing classes, a lot of people are taught to do what I call "vomitting on
paper." You just write whatever's on your mind, stream of conscious style. Get a
bunch of stuff down and then go back and revise. Move things around, maybe
organize stuff into bullet points. Delete some stuff. Rinse and repeat.

This is what I do with a lot of my blog posts. If I really want to polish, I'll
iterate a lot. For other posts (like this one) maybe just once is enough.

Similarly with song writing, what I like to do is just sit down and turn on the
recorder on my phone. Always, 100% of the time. Even if I have no idea what I'm
going to play, or if I'm just fooling around. That's because my best creative
work happens when I'm in the moment, just playing around, not worried about
sounding dumb or playing the wrong thing. And if the recorder's on, I can always
go back and remember those moments, taking the best ones and stitching them
together into something coherent.

So you can kind of apply this to math, right? Most people wouldn't
say that math is like writing an essay or a song. But really it is. And it's
just as creative.

This is the problem with math homework and tests. The kids are worried about
 getting bad grades, so they don't take risks; their imagination just shuts
 down. But really, to see *why* an answer might be true, you have to throw a
 bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. A lot of math problems can't be
 solved by just applying formulas and shuffling around symbols. You really have
 to see [the
 analogies](https://betterexplained.com/articles/math-and-analogies/) and know
 where you're going, so each step you take is in the right direction.

Really, writing a proof is just something you do *after* you've basically solved
the problem. It's for the benefit of other people (and yourself), so that you
can prove to them (and yourself) that something is true. But it doesn't really
reflect how you got there.

So my process for doing math is more or less the same as writing songs and
essays. I get a copious amount of paper, write down my problem, and then I write
down anything that comes to mind, as it comes to mind. If I need to draw
pictures, I draw pictures. If I need to write down an equation and annotate what
each part really means, I do that.

This helps me really "go down the rabbit hole" so to speak. If I try to solve a
math problem in my head without writing anything down, I can only keep track of
1 or 2 possibilities, and follow those ideas a few steps each. But if I write
everything down, it's like I have inifinite brain space. And then I'm not afraid
to try crazy ideas.

But the key thing, again, is playing around. If I ever feel like doing the math
is a chore, I know I'm going to have a bad time, and that's the only time when math
ever really feels "hard."
