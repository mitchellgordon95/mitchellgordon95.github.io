I interned with Uber in the Spring of 2016. I maintained and improved Bliss, Uber's in-house replacement for Zendesk, as it scaled to 30 million users in China. I wrote a bunch of features, like a distributed redis-based rate limiter, and squelched more bugs than I can count. I also wrote an analytics tool for Bliss on top of Elasticsearch.
