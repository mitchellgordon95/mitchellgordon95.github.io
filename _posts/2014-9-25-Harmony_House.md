I wrote the website for Team Tennessee, the now defunct Solar Decathlon team from Vanderbilt University. Due to funding constraints we never got to finish the project, but the website still stands, at least temporarily, at teamtennessee.org. It was my first experience with Wordpress, and I can't say I enjoyed it.
