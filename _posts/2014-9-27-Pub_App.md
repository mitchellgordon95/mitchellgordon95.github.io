I wrote an app for Vanderbilt University Campus Dining. The app lets students browse the menu at the pub and notifies them when their order is ready to be picked up. You can download it on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vandyapps.pubandroid&hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.
