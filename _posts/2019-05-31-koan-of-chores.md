Each morning, the monks drew lots to assign chores for the day.

After one drawing, a monk approached the master.

"Master, the lots have become marked from use, and some monks use this to select the
easiest chores. We have tried many methods, but eventually some regularity is
learned and exploited. How can we assign the chores randomly?"

The master replied, "what is not random?"

The monk thought for a moment. "When the outcome is known."

The master handed the monk a blindfold.

"Then do not try to know."

The monk was enlightened.
