I had a few free weeks during the summer of 2014. My friend Carlton, called me up one day and said the startup he was working at in Nashville needed an Android developer, so I jumped in to help the team out. Their lead Android developer was on vacation, so I took over debugging and adding features for those few weeks. That application was Quarc, a mobile application for patient-centric messaging in hospitals.
