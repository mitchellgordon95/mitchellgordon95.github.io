This is a graphics-oriented command line interface that has some of the basic features of industry standard computer graphics applications, like Renderman or Photoshop. It was created originally as a semester-long project for CS 258, Introduction to Computer Graphics, as an exercise in understanding. It's built on top of OpenGL for cross platform window support, but as the name suggests, it attempts to implement most features using basic C++ functionality. Above you can see one of the images rendered by the raytracer part of the program.
