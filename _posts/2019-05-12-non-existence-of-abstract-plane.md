title:  "The Non-Existence of The Abstract Plane"
categories: philosophy
---

I mostly think about abstract ideas. I study machine learning and natural
language processing, so I spend all day learning calculus and linear algebra
(abstract) to try to teach computers what the word "happy" means (also
abstract). That way, when you ask Siri or Alexa to find you a happy family
photo, they'll actually be able to do it.

Most of my problems come from the fact that these things are abstract, and
therefore hard to define. For example, to teach a computer what "happy" means,
first you have to be able to define "happy" in terms of numbers and pixels.
This is non-trivial. Some might say it's impossible; "happy" is too abstract to
really define concretely. It's an idea that lives in the "abstract plane." (And
yet you could probably find me a happy photo if you tried.)

Similarly, mathematical abstractions caused me a lot of headaches. I never
seemed to be able to ground myself when talking about mathematics; it felt like
math also existed in the "abstract plane" - outside of the real, physical
universe - where the rules constantly changed depending on the context. Example:
$$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$$ means the derivative of a function $$f(x)$$. But then, at
some point in school, people started [multiplying both
sides](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/47092/physicists-not-mathematicians-can-multiply-both-sides-with-dx-why)
of an equation by $$dx$$. What the hell? What does that mean? Why was that
allowed?

This post is about the most helpful thing I've done in my studies: throw out the
"abstract plane." I don't think it exists. In fact, I think it's a lazy,
non-scientific way of thinking, and getting rid of it has been the only way I've
been able to distinguish sense from nonsense when talking about math and
language.

I'm about to get pretty pedantic about what I mean by "abstract" here, so a
little thought experiment might make things clearer.

## The Copy-Universe Thought Experiment

Imagine we want to make a simulated copy of our universe. We want our copy-universe to behave
exactly like the original, so that in 10 seconds, or 10 days, both the universes
are still indistinguishable. What do we need to copy?

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Well, from high-school chemistry we know that everything in the universe is made
out of matter, so we'll probably need that. So we can copy all the atoms and
molecules exactly. You know, the wood molecules stuck together to form your
kitchen table, the oxygen atoms bouncing off your skin, etc.

Is that all we need? Well, I suppose we'll also need to keep track of energy
levels, right? How fast are the particles are moving and what direction are they
moving in? We'd also probably want to copy light, too. (Or is light matter?
Photons are like waves and particles, right? Whatever. )

</div>

Anyway, here's the million dollar question:

#### Is there some "abstract plane" that I also need to copy to my copy-universe?

How would we even do that? We already copied everything we could think of. What's left?
If the abstract plane really never interacts with the physical universe, then it
should equally never interact with our simulated copy-universe. So why do we need it?

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Consider: if I make a perfect physical copy of Galileo, but I "forget" the
abstract plane, it's not like Galileo won't know what a triangle is anymore. His
brain, which is made out of atoms and neurons, which we copied, will still be
exactly the same, and Galileo will do his usual Galileo things. He'll still be
able to walk around, breathe, and talk about triangles. There's no reason to
believe there's some special property of his brain that would behave differently
in the presence of an abstract plane. His brain is just a machine, with wet
cogs. It's just atoms, moving in accordance with the usual laws of physics.[^1]

So the abstract idea of "triangles" doesn't really live in the abstract plane;
it lives in the physical brains / neural circuits of everyone who knows what a
triangle is and can name them.

You can tell I'm kind of waving my hands with the physics here. There's probably
all sorts of things I've missed (dark matter, quantum effects, etc.). But I'll
leave the quantum theory to the physicists. For my intents and purposes,
thinking about brains and stuff, I'll answer with a resounding no, we don't have
to worry about the abstract plane. 

## Practical Physicalism

So what's the alternative? How should we think about abstract things? Ideally,
any new idea we encounter should be broken down in terms of our existing model
of how the world works. This is [first
principles](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/) thinking, where you
maintain a core set of fundamental knowledge and build up all other concepts on
top of those. Abstract ideas shouldn't be an exception, they should be included
in our single, unified model of How Things Work. If we let them live in the
"abstract plane" where anything goes, we stop being able to apply reason and
common-sense to them.

<h6>Richard Feynman and Elon Musk love this type of thinking. </h6>
</div>

But what should that core set be? For me, talking about brains and happiness and
stuff, classical physics is good enough. At the end of the day, everything that
matters to me can be conceptualized as groups of atoms or the movement of atoms
over time. This is very close to Stephen Wolfram's [new kind of
science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/), where everything in the natural
world can be viewed as a mechanistic computation. The universe is a machine,
whose parts follow some basic rules through time. It's also very close to the
philosophy of [physicalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/),
which asserts that everything is physically manifested.

Physicalism makes some bold claims about *everything*, which I can't really
support. Instead, I use what I've been calling **Practical Physicalism**:
everything that matters *to me* must be physically manifested. Here's a simple
litmus test for whether something is physically manifested:

Can you touch it, see it, or otherwise sense it? If not, could you
theoretically build a device that would let you measure / observe it
indirectly? If so, that thing is physically manifested and worth discussing.

</div>


It's a very practical definition, hence the name. And to me, it makes a lot of
sense. If something is truly "abstract," and you can never see it, touch it, or
observe it, even indirectly or theoretically... if it never impacts your world,
even minutely, then why should you care about it? If something is truly
abstract, it's not worth discussing, because it will never impact any event in
your life.

This forces us to define abstract things concretely, in terms of physics, rather
than letting them be some ethereal non-existence. Even if the only physical
manifestation is some esoteric neural circuit in your brain, that can't be
observed any other way than cracking open your skull and measuring the
electrical potentials.

<h6>Source - <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1199">Quantifying the visual concreteness of words and topics

</div>

It also allows us to start thinking about *how* concrete or abstract things are.
For example, check out [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1199)
on operationalizing and quantifying "abstract-ness" and "concreteness" for
specific machine learning datasets that are grounded in pictures. That might
help us solve our "happiness" problem.


So I've said that this way of thinking has really helped me come to terms with
math and language, but I haven't said *how*. That's a longer discussion, so I
think I'll save it for another post.

And yes, all models are wrong. But I think this model of thinking is very useful,
especially in a field like machine learning and natural language processing where
all we do is think about thinking. Dispelling the "abstract plane" idea early on
will benefit everyone, I think.

[^1]: What if brains *are* special? That is, they don't obey the normal laws of
    physics, like gravity? Well, then maybe we could call that effect the
    "abstract plane," and say that its observable, physical manifestation is to
    subvert gravity (or electromechanics etc.) to make our brains behave
    differently than normal physical systems. This would be fine. We can update
    the physics textbooks. My problem isn't the existence or non-existence of
    the abstract plane, but its usage as an excuse to do lazy science /
    engineering.
