I write software and build things that need to be built. I believe in simplicity as a rule in design and in life. My hobbies include making music, skateboarding, and speaking Japanese.

I attend Vanderbilt University as an undergraduate and will earn a Computer Science degree by December of 2015. I may go on to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, but I have not decided on a specialization yet because so many things interest me. I find computer security, artificial intelligence, brain-computer interaction, and quantum computing particularly intriguing.
