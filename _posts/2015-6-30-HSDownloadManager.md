An anime tracker and downloader for Windows. During my internship at Epic, I had to learn C#/WPF for part of the work. In my free time at home, I made this application to help familiarize myself with the technology. It uses an IRC library to connect to the file-sharing hosts of a certain fan-subbing group called Horrible Subs, and then downloads episodes as they become available using the XDCC protocol.
