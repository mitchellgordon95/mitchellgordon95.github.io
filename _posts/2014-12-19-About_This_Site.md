This site uses Polymer to implement Web Components, a great new technology that brings HTML back from the stone age. It also attempts to conform to the material design standard, which gives UI elements physical properties such as depth and makes the user experience more intuitive.

I use the Jekyll blogging system to statically render the site after each update. Hopefully it makes everything snappy for you.
