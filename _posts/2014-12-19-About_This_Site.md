This site is hosted by Github pages; you can view the source <a href="https://github.com/mitchellgordon95/mitchellgordon95.github.io">here</a>. It attempts to conform to the material design standard, which gives UI elements physical properties such as depth and makes the user experience more intuitive. Since the site is hosted by Github pages, it leverages the Jekyll blogging framework, which statically renders the site after each update.

In earlier versions, I used Web Components by including Google's Polymer library. Web Components is a great idea currently moving through the W3C standards vetting process which makes web dev classy again. Feel free to read about it <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">here</a>. However, the library's polyfill overhead turned out to be too much for this simple site, so I replaced that functionality using some fancy CSS3 styling.
