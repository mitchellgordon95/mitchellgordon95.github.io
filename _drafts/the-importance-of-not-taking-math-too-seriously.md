When you're doing math, and you're on a deadline, or you're super serious and
worried about being wrong, your mind clamps up. It's a fight or flight thing.
You have trouble adapting to new ideas or seeing things in a different light.

I see the same thing happen when I try to write songs or essays. If you try to
write the perfect song on your first try, you'll never be able to write a single
word. You'll freeze up.

In song writing, and in essays, what a lot of people do is what I call
"vomitting on the paper." You just write whatever's on your mind, stream of
conscious style. Get a bunch of stuff down, and then go back and revise.
Move things around, maybe organize stuff into bullet points. Delete some stuff.

Rinse and repeat. This is what I do with a lot of my blog posts.

Specifically with song writing, what I like to do is just sit down and turn on the
recorder on my phone. Always. Like, 100% of the time. Even if I have no idea
what I'm going to play, if I'm just fooling around. Then I can do whatever I
want, and not worry about having to remember what I did.

A lot of the time I'll be really in the moment and do something that sounds
really interesting. But then 2 minutes later, I'll try to go back and remember,
and I just can't. I can't get the melody right, or the rhythm just doesn't feel
the same. That's why I started recording myself, and I feel like it's really
made me better. Now I don't worry about sounding dumb or playing the wrong thing.
I just play around. And sometimes something amazing happens

"Play" is the keyword, I think. The best creative work happens when you feel
like you're playing around.

So you can kind of apply this to math, right? And, yeah, most people wouldn't
say that math is like writing an essay or a song. But really it is. And it's
just as creative.

This is the problem with math homework. The kids are worried about their grades
and getting the right answer. So they don't take risks; their imagination just
shuts down. But really, to see *why* an answer might be true, you have to throw
a bunch of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. A lot of math problems can't
be solved by just applying formulas and shuffling around symbols. You really
have to see the analogies and know where you're going, so each step you
take is in the right direction.

Really, writing a proof is just something you do *after* you've basically solved
the problem. It's for the benefit of other people (and yourself), so that you
can prove to them (and yourself) that something is true. But it doesn't really
reflect how you got there.

So my process for doing math is more or less the same as writing songs and
essays. Get a copious amount of paper, write down your problem, and then write
down anything that comes to mind, as it comes to mind. If I need to draw
pictures, I draw pictures. And this helps me really "go down the rabbit hole" so
to speak. If I try to solve a math problem in my head without writing anything
down, I can only keep track of 1 or 2 possibilities, and follow those ideas a
few steps each. But if I write everything down, it's like I have inifinite brain
space. And then I'm not afraid to try crazy ideas.

But the key thing, again, is playing around. If I ever feel like doing the math
is a chore, I know I'm going to have a bad time, and that's the only time when math
ever really feels "hard."
