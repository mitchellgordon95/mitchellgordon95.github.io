1. What is chance? Does it exist if the universe is deterministic? How do we reason under uncertainty? 
2. Problems with induction. Will the sun rise tomorrow? Feeding the chicken.
3. Classical Probability: equiprobable cases, symmetry. Deck of cards, clubs.
4. Frequentism. Limiting relative frequencies. Problems with frequentism (incorporating prior information, identifying similar events)
5. Chance -> Frequency. Bernoulli. Weak law of large numbers. Bernoulli's swindle.
6. Frequency -> Chance. Bayes. Probability is subjective. Laplace. Skeptics converge to the truth, given enough data.
7. De Finnetti. Coherence implies probability theory. The dutch book. Alternatively, an extension of propositional logic.
8. Chance does not exist?  Exchangability. Justifying subjective probability, unification. Strong law of large numbers.
