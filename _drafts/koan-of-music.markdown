The student sought enlightenment.

"Master, what is best?"

The master answered, "play me the best music, and I will tell you the best way to live."

So the student purchased a lute from a local merchant and played the master a song.

"That is not best," the master said. 

So the student traveled to the city and sought out the most famous lute players. She spent a year there, mastering seven genres.

She returned to the master and played her best seven songs.

"That is not best," the master said.

In a fury, the student smashed the lute on the ground repeatedly, making a great cacophony.

"Ah, finally! You have played the best music... for me."

The student was enlightened.
