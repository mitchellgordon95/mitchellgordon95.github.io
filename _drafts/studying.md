studying is basically the act of sculpting your brain into a certain shape, over
many days, though the brain is constantly changing with every second.
Connections that aren't being used are withering away, but whenever you think of
two things in proximity to each other, the connections become stronger.

Like sculpting, if you try to study too fast it's not likely to go well. You
might accidentally break off a big chunk, things get unstable real fast if you
hit too hard. You might end up with weird connections that are all jumbled up.
And it's likely to hurt.

Better to go slowly, building solid connections that won't easily fade for very
important concepts that generally apply to many other areas (like linear
algebra). The rest will come naturally, no use studying what you won't use. The
connections will fade anyway. Studying is basically a way of life. Immerse
yourself in what you want to become, and your brain, which is always adapting,
will naturally accomodate the important things.
