## Practical Physicalism and Zen
- Duality
  - The name is just a brain circuit, the boundaries don't really exist.
  - Consider a definition legfloor. When a chair is in contact with the floor,
    the legfloor is the two inches of the chair's leg closest to the floor,
    along with the surrounding 2 inches of floor. Those are the atoms we mean by
    legfloor. Note that you don't need a word for chair and floor to define
    legfloor. You can just go around pointing at legfloors and talking about
    them, and eventually everyone will know what you mean, even if they can't
    quite put their finger on it (or come up with a definition in words, since
    they don't know what a chair is either).
  - The atoms that I call a chair can simultaneously be chair but also legfloor.
    This is what I understand to be duality. At any given moment in time, the
    universe is simply a big clump of atoms and molecules stuck together. The
    boundaries we place between different parts of it are simply hallucinations
    that help us simplify our world view. It would be exhausting to consider
    every single atom of the chair independently. Better to call it a chair, and
    have a little brain circuit for it. Much easier.
  - But! Imagine a universe in which the floor was always very sticky, and had a
    tendency to become uprooted whenever you picked your feet up.
  - "John picked up the chair, and then tapped the legfloor on the wall, to remove the debris."
  - boundaries between concepts (wittgenstein)
  - But, everyone comes up with names for similar things, even in different
    parts of the world... chairs, balls, etc. Why is that? (island nations tend
    to have words for towards the mountain and towards the sea.) There might be
    some computational explanation for this... everyone's brains are wired the
    same by genetics, so we have the same brain circuits that fire on the same
    types of regularities (balls and animals and stuff, not legfloor). Or, maybe
    even deeper, that any intelligent entity *must* pick up on certain
    regularities in the universe to be intelligent.
- Universe and self
  - Applying the concept of duality to your own body. If the boundaries between
    objects is a hallucination, then your body, too, is simply part of the
    universe. This can be seen when you inhale and exhale. At what point, when
    you inhale, does the air stop being the outside world, and start being you?
    In truth, we are constantly exchanging material with the world (we eat,
    drink, breath, shed skin, etc.). So there is a self (because your brain can
    recognize it), but also there is no self.
- Will and consciousness
- Time and action are inseparable
  - either doing or not doing
  
A zen buddhist is never confused. Is this the aim of zen buddhism? To be at peace, and not be confused? Surely, practicing zen buddhism will lead you to a peaceful life, contemplative and content. Understanding suffering, worrying not about good and bad, what should and should not be done. Just what is happening right now, and living in your own body.

But how can we not think about the future? Should I walk across the street without looking both ways? Should I lay down and die? That would be peaceful. Considering hypothetical worlds is baked into the human brain.

Perhaps the point of buddhism is not to be at peace, but simply seek truth. By knowing the truth, peace is a side-effect. But perhaps, if we learn more truth, peace no longer is with us.

## Practical Fatalism
So maybe we can be aware of duality, that all things are one, that time and action are inseparable, that we have no will, but we do.

Do not always seek peace? Emotions are a valuable feedback. When bad things happen to you, emotions change your behavior. But we can always be aware of the true nature of things, so that we recognize the true nature of our emotions: tools for changing ourselves. Do not be angry at external causes; they are part of you. Do not be sad for what you have missed; it could not have been any other way. Do not resent your opressor; he does not recognize his Buddha nature.

Seeking peace is futile; the universe is one, and moves as it will. Either you will find peace or you will not.

All we can do is seek peace. If we lay down to die, we will die.

We have free will, but we do not. Duality.
