A popular way of pursuing truth is through "first principles." You start with
the irreducible things that you know, and attempt to understand new phenomena by
combining your "first principles."

This got me thinking about what my first principles are. How do I comprehend the
world?

When confronted with something that doesn't make sense (especially in AI and
mathemathics), I usually fall back to this one: anything that matters must have
a physical manifestation. This took me a while to get to.

On one hand, this seems perfectly reasonable. A little dumb, even. If you can't
ever touch, hear, or see something, why should you care about it? Under this definition, something without a physical manifestation will never influence your life in any way.

On the other hand, I catch a lot of flak for this view from my friends and
colleagues... what about the mind? The soul? Fiction? Mathematics, language? How
is a word physically manifested? How could I claim any of these don't matter?

This conflict is just a miscommunication, I think. Let me explain.

Sure, Harry Potter's wizarding world is never physically manifested *exaclty* as
described in the book. Wizards do not exist.[^1] But, that world *does* have
physical manifestations. For example, take the words, printed in millions of
novels across the world. Sure, those are physical. I could also go visit
Hogwarts castle in Disney World. That's real. And finally, if you're a fan,
reading the novels[^2] has a lasting impact on the neural connections in your
brain. Harry Potter is physically manifested in our brains (hearts?) and
therefore matters.

So it's reasonable to talk about Harry Potter theories, but only so long as we
keep in mind the ways in which Harry Potter will [physically
manifest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald#Critical_response).
We can talk all day about how Harry Potter *ought* to be, but in the end, J.K.
Rolling and the movie directors will have the final say.

There's a lot more to say here about math, language, and the mind, but I'll leave it for another day.

[^2]: I only read the first one. Sorry.
