## Physical Manifestations: A Trick for Understanding
### First Principles
  - When understanding something unfamiliar, we break it down into basic
    building blocks, and reconstruct them using simpler rules
  - This lets us understand the world with a very limited set of things we have
    to memorize, making it easy to apply our knowledge to new situations
  - This is in contrast to reasoning by analogy, where we build a much longer
    list of associations between things, and use those associations to predict
    future events. This is a brittle understanding of the world, and doesn't
    always hold up in new situations. It might still be useful, however, in cases
    where not enough information is known to reason using first principles?
    

### Physical Manifestations
  - A natural question is: when breaking a hard problem down into simpler
    building blocks, what is the simplest thing we can stop at?
  - This usually depends on you and your domain. For example, many people take
    1+1=2 for granted, as a base truth. (it might not, depending on context.
    tropical semiring)
  - For me, in a totally new domain with nothing to latch onto, 
    everything that I care about must have some physical manifestation.
  - In other words, if I can't conceptualize something any other way, I will at
    least be able to think of the thing either as a collection of atoms, or some 
    process in which atoms change and interact over time.
  - Things that are physically manifested must be able to be seen, heard,
    touched, tasted, smelled, or otherwise observed (even with assistance, like
    telescopes or spectrometers).
  - If I can't ever possibly interact with the thing in question, then I've
    decided I don't care about it, since by definition it will never impact me.
    
so for any given concept or word, i only care about it if you can give me a
definition in terms of physical manifestations otherwise i'll dismiss it as
nonsense

Might be wrong (dark matter and quantum mechanics etc.) but all models are
wrong. Good enough for studying and engineering intelligent systems.
  
### Practical Uses
  - Often, in higher studies, esoteric terms are used, and often defined in
    terms of other esoteric things which sometimes feels circular. It is useful
    practice to attempt to "ground out" the definitions, following the chain
    until you get to something that can be observed in a real life situation.
  - This is especially true in mathematics, where the topics often are so
    abstract that it seems they couldn't possibly be physically manifested
    anywhere except for the mind of the one who came up with it.
  - It's useful, then to imagine different scenarios in which the mathematics
    might actual describe a real world situation. Or two or three, if you can
    come up with them (see imagination in mathematics / poetry quote). 
  - Often, you can trace a mathematical theory back to its historical roots, and
    see the motivations of the person who came up with it. Example: Shannon,
    info theory, and telegraphs. Numbers, counting. Negative numbers, debt?
  - Other times, the person who came up with the math will have just been trying
    to make an existing notion more abstract (see arithmetic and rings)
  - Thinking of physical manifestations lets us think about abstract concepts
    with a little more clarity. In some cases, we will decide to focus on the
    physical manifestations of a concept, rather than contemplating it in the
    abstract.
  - It lets us sniff out nonsense a little bit quicker.
  - Analogies are what makes math beautiful. People think in metaphors.

This seems like one of those things that's really dumb, and everyone understood
implicitly except for me. Or is it? The idea that everything can be physically
manifested is somewhat philosophically controversial. What about love, language,
and math? It's not clear how to ground many things in the real world. Sometimes
there's none, and sometimes there's many different ways. More next time.
    
    
## Practical Physicalism: a Philosophy

Friend said my views line up with physicalism. Not really
[physicalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/), i don't get any
of that stuff. It seems like they're talking about whether or not *everything*
is *actually* physical, without thinking about the fallibility of our senses, or
the fact that we might all live in the matrix. My idea about this is much more
practical. We might call it Practical Physicalism.

### The Practical Phyiscalism Axiom
An axiom is something that we take to be self-evident. This is kind of an abuse of terminology, since an axiom is a math thing, which you usually base all of your future arguments off of. So it kind of feels right to call it an axiom, even though we're not really proving theorems.

Axiom: Necessarily everything that matters *to me* must have a *observable* physical manifestation.

Self-evident proof (which I originally gave to my girlfriend) [TODO: edit to not be consciousness specific]: 

1  
so let's suppose there is something
that's impossible to measure or observe
and therefore does not have a physical manifestation.
ðŸ˜®
2  
if that thing can't be observed
then that thing can't possibly interact with our brains
or influence our behavior
ðŸ˜®
3  
and so with or without that thing
we say and do things exactly as before
ðŸ˜®
4  
and someone without that thing
can write down a definition of a triangle in euclidean geometry
ðŸ˜®
5  
so therefore, i don't care about that thing
since it doesn't change the world at all
because if it changed the world
i would be able to measure it

Also remember: all models are wrong. At the end of the day, physicalism might be
wrong because of dark matter, or quantum mechanics or something. But, for the
purposes of engineering intelligent systems and defining semantics, I think this
might be sufficient.

### The Copy-World Thought Experiment
[TODO] Look up physicalists.

- Everything is physically manifested? 
  - Not everything I can think of exists as atoms or interactions between atoms, right?
  - What about abstract ideas? It's really hard to ground some concepts as atoms
    (see theoretical math). Other ideas might have many different ways to ground
    them. Like love, for instance, can be observed in many very different
    circumstances. (write this as a question to the author)
  - Well, maybe. Counterpoint: everything in the universe is made of matter. It's all stuff. That's chemistry.
  - I'll assert something very controversial: there is no "higher plane of
    existence" in which abstract concepts live. There's only here and now, with
    atoms and molecules and stuff. "Abstract stuff" can be thought of physically
    as the configuration of your brain's atoms. They're hallucinations, that let
    us deal with an unfathomably huge universe using our finite little ape
    brains.
  - This is a bit freeing. There is no "correct" hallucination for you to have,
    just like there's no "correct" way of thinking about a math problem. Sure,
    you're answer still needs to line up with the real world eventually, but
    there's as many ways of getting there as there are analogies you can come up
    with. When people ask me if I'm "mathematically literate," this is usually actually what I think of. (Although most people mean, do you know arithmetic, calculus, linear algebra, etc.)
  - Let's do a thought exeperiment: say you wanted to take a snapshot of the
    universe right now, and wanted to recreate it later. What would you need to
    remember?
  - I suspect you would need something like the positions of all the atoms, and
    their energies (whether they're moving or not). I *don't* think you'd need
    to keep a seperate list of all the concepts "in the abstract plane."
    Anything that exists in the "abstract plane" would be implied by the
    material universe.
  - How would you even copy over the "abstract plane?"
  - In other words, as long as you recreate my brain, all the abstract concepts my brain can come up with will also be recreated.
  - If there are no people in the universe, no ideas get recreated.
  - If you recreate all the people, all their ideas will be taken with them.
  - Danger is a good example. Everyone's danger is different (Alex honnold v
    world). Average brain circuit. Can define danger in terms of the situations
    that activate the danger brain circuit, causing a person to say the word
    danger.
    
    

### You, a Venus Fly Trap
  - Main point: we have no reason to believe that the stuff inside your head (or
    body) is exempt from the laws of physics. Your brain is made out
    atoms and chemicals and stuff.
  
  - A venus fly trap is like a mouse trap, but instead of a spring, it has neurons.
  - [TODO: maybe actually do some research]
  - We're basically more complicated versions of venus fly traps. Our brains
    basically take sensory input, remember past sensory input and actions, and
    predict future sensory input and actions. Yes, it's beautiful. But the parts
    that make it happen are also very simple.
  - Simlulate a worm in a box. We can do this because it's all just atoms and
    chemicals. It's hard, but whatever. (insert picture from that connectome
    experiment)
  - Chinese supercomputer that simulated one second of thought?
  - Man in a box?
    
  But! The copy-world argument doesn't rest on this. Even if the brain *is*
  exempt from the usual effects of the universe through some spooky mechanism,
  that mechanism is *necessarily* measurable, and therefore physically manifested.
  
  
  - Bottom line: "Thought" depending on how you define it, either has a physical
    manifestation, or it doesn't. This is a theme we'll see over and over again
    for all abstract concepts related to the brain. Since, to me, the only
    reasonable way to talk about things is in terms of physical manifestations, I'll only talk about thought with the following definition:
  - "Thought," if it is measurable, must be manifested as the activations or
  other interactions of atoms in the brain, as well as the associated actions
  (speaking, moving, etc.) that arise from that thought. (all man can do is
  move) (consciousness is trickier)
  - so yeah, all abstract concepts are manifested physically in the brains of
    the poeple who think about them, and give them names. It's just a question
    of how prevalent that concept is. is it just one guy? or is it a whole
    population, that have brain circuits that fire on very similar situations. (more on this later)

### The Zombies Counter-argument
  - [TODO] actually read the zombies counter
  - There is a very westworld-ish question to ask. If I make a perfect copy of
    myself in this manner, with all the atoms perfectly the same, does the copy
    have a soul? What about consciousness? [the
    prestige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHKan75x7GI&t=1m47s)
  - This is a very tricky question. I also think it's not worth considering,
    unless someone can define "soul" for me. What is a soul, in terms of atoms,
    or processes on atoms? How do we observe a soul?
  - If the answer is "you can't observe it," then I don't care. Certainly, if
    you want to believe in things you'll never observe, go right ahead. But,
    personally, I just can't bring myself to do that. (it would be nice, though,
    to believe god cared). And if you can't tell me how the concept of "a soul"
    will impact me, then I don't think there's a right or wrong choice for
    believing whether a soul exists.
  - I would 
    
Ok, enough about souls. Let's talk about ideas now. More next time.


## Practical Physicalism: Perspectives on Math and Language
    
- So what is an idea?
  - Ideas and brains are inextricably intertwined.
  - An idea is basically the shape of your brain, which allows you to connect
    two physically manifested things that aren't exactly the same.
  - In other words, an idea is the shape of a particular brain circuit.
  - Other people might have similar brain circuits, that let them see similar
    connections between things. This is what we mean when two people share an
    idea. "The ocean breeze carressed his face like a gentle lover." (see
    metaphors we live by. all language is fundamentally rooted in metaphor.)

- How concrete or abstract is an idea?
  - Some ideas seem like they're easier to find physical manifestations for than
    others.
  - Some ideas have a high variety of physical manifestations, while others only
    have one.
  - For example, my grandma is very concrete. I have a brain circuit that
    recognizes when I see my grandma, or pictures of my grandma, or my grandma's
    voice on the telephone. These observations are all very closely related to
    the atoms that make up my grandma, so there's very little variation between
    them. The brain ciruit is fairly specific. It might associate my
    observations of my grandma with other things related to my grandma: it might
    conjure up the delicious smell of grandma's cooking, or her house, etc.
  - On the other hand, the idea of grandmas in general is more abstract. There
    is a lot more variation in observations of grandmas in general than just my
    grandma.
  - At the extreme of abstract, we might consider the mathematical idea of a
    triangle. The brain circuit for triangles can fire for many many things in
    the real world, with utmost variation. Triforce, trees, etc. But notice that
    the idea of "triangle" doesn't exist on some higher plane of abstraction.
    The only things that exist are the brain circuit for recognizing triangles,
    as well as the things that trigger the brain circuit. So we can "define"
    abstract ideas by the shape of the brain circuit and the things that make it
    fire (which is implied by the shape).
  - Concreteness of a word (which we associate with an idea) depends on context.
    Just like all meaning depends on context. (more on this.)
  - See the operational definition given by that paper.

But the way we've defined my grandma here implies she's also manifested... as a picture? And as cooking? That can't be right, can it? What is a thing? More next time.
  
- What is language?
  - See the zen post
  - something about wittgenstein and the use theory of meaning.
  - something about zen and duality

[TODO: math as a more restricted form of language]
- As defined above, mathematics is a fairly abstract concept.
  - When someone says math, they can mean:
    - The act of reasoning performed by a person to predict the future based on
      the present. In this setting, we must perform proofs of the things we want
      to prove, restricted by some laws of inference. Math helps guide us away
      from incorrect intuition, since it's very easy to lie to ourselves.
    - A language, which is written to communicate *general* ideas (that may or
      may not relate to real world situations) in the most terse and unambiguous
      way possible. Language helps you think, also (see Sapir-Whorf), so maybe
      having a [vocabulary for certain
      ideas](https://betterexplained.com/articles/why-do-we-learn-math/) helps
      you apply them.
    - A real formalism (as in the MU puzzle), which is basically a game in which
      symbols are shuffled around.
    - A method of abstraction, a way of ignoring the messy details of a problem
      and only representing the heart of it.
  - Much math will only ever be physically manifested in the minds of its
    practitioners and the documents they write.
  - There is not always a good motivation. Sometimes mathematicians just think
    about these things because they're cool. Should we abandon all of
    theoretical mathematics, because we cannot find a physical manifestation of
    these things, outside the brain?
  - Sometimes, thouh, the symbols we write on paper will serendipitously
    describe the real world, and allow us to predict the future, given the
    present, with great accuracy. This is perhaps one of the great mysteries of
    science. (see the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural
    science)
  - Even if not, theoretical mathematics can still be a joy, even if the really
    esoteric stuff amounts to intellectual masturbation, essentially.

- Grounding out math into analogies makes math a joy. (see better explained).
  And [this
  one](https://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-develop-a-mindset-for-math/)
  It's like a raft that gets us across the river. There are many different ways
  to get there, these provide imagination and intuition, which can be refined
  and made rigorous
  - You should never try to prove anything that's not almost obvious. -Some famous math guy
